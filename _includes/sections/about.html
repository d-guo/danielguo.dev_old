<div>
    I am a 2nd year undergraduate at the University of California Santa Barbara studying computer science and mathematics in the College of Creative Studies. My interests are scattered but broadly relate to mathematics, computer science, philosophy, rubik's cubes, and badminton. Currently, I am working on projects related to machine learning, differential equations, and cryptography. I love to talk to new people, so if you think we could have interesting conversation, please reach out!
