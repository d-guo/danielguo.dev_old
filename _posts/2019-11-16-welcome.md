First off, thank you for taking the time to check out my website! It is formatted to be part blog and part personal website. I'm starting this blog with the intention to share some of the things I'm learning as a student and aspiring researcher / mathematician / computer scientist, and I hope that others share my excitement for these topics. Generally, these posts will be separated into the following categories (for a more updated and detailed list, peep the blog posts section and sort by category):

* educational expositions on academic topics broadly relating to mathematics and computer science
* academic and career experiences
* philosophy and my thoughts
* personal life.

I'm excited to start on this project, and I think it will be a good exercise for myself, as well as (hopefully) informative and fun for others to read. Feel free to reach out and start a conversation through email or on linkedin (both links on sidebar for web or topbar for mobile)! See you guys in the coming posts :)
