    <h1>Hi! I'm Daniel Guo.</h1>

    <p class="home-para">
        Thanks for stopping by my website! <br> <br>
        
        I'm an undergrad at UCSB studying computer science and mathematics in CCS. <br> <br>
        
        My interests broadly relate to mathematics, computer science, philosophy, rubik's cubes, and badminton. Currently, I'm working on projects related to machine learning, differential equations, and cryptography. !
